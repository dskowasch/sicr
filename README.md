# sicr

sicr is an R package to implement the stochastic individual claims reserving which was first published by Dirk 
Skowasch and Torsten Grabarz (see 08.03.2022 on <https://www.qx-club.de/ARCHIV/>). 
It is based on the paper of 
[Murphy & McLennan](<https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/database/forum_06fforum_209.pdf>) but extends it in 
some areas for better applicability under Solvency II. 

## Installation

You can install the package via the Github repository:

```s
# install.package("remotes") # In case you have not installed it.
remotes::install_github("dskowasch/sicr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Get started

The sicr package [vignette](https://dskowasch.github.io/sicr/articles/sicr.html) describes the usage in
detail with a complete example.
