#' Helper function to create a matrix with indices per claim stemming from reinsurance treaty clause
#'
#' @description
#' This helper function converts the dataframes `reinsurance` and `indices` into a matrix with
#' one row per claim and one column for each past year from `first_orig_year` to `last_orig_year` and
#' for 250 future calendar years. \cr
#' This matrix will be used to properly calculate the reinsurance payments.
#'
#'
#' @param claims_list dataframe of claims generated with [generate_claims_list()].
#' @param reinsurance dataframe of reinsurance structures, see details of [xl_cashflow()].
#' @param indices dataframe for indexation, see details of [prepare_data()].
#' @param first_orig_year integer value for the first origin year, will be treated as the first observed calendar year.
#' @param last_orig_year integer value for the last origin year which will also be treated as the last calendar year,
#' usually the calendar year that just ended.
#'
#' @return numeric matrix with one row per claim and one column for each past and 250 future calendar years. Entries
#' for years before the claim origin year are set to 1. The other entries are indexation factors.

#' Calculate reinsurer's payments for xl-treaty
#'
#' @description

#' read the details section for further information.
#'
#' @param future_payments numeric matrix with one row per claim and 250 columns for future payments.
#' @param claims_list dataframe of claims generated with [generate_claims_list()].
#' @param history numeric matrix with one row per claim with historic payments, generated by [generate_history_per_claim()]. \cr
#' If generated in other ways, note that colnames must be the origin years.
#' @param reinsurance dataframe of reinsurance structures, see details.
#' @param indices dataframe for indexation, default NULL. See details of [prepare_data()].
#' Only one of `indices` and `xl_indices_per_claim` may be NULL.
#' @param xl_indices_per_claim numeric indexation matrix, default NULL. See details of [generate_xl_indices_per_claim()].
#' Only one of `indices` and `xl_indices_per_claim` may be NULL.
#' @param output desired output as character, one of `history`, `future` and `total`.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' This function uses historic and future payments per claim to derive the reinsurer's payments for the xl-treaty. \cr
#' The calculation becomes rather complicated as there are several common indexation clauses (also referred to as
#' Stability Clause or Inflation Clause), all of them with the idea of sharing the increase of claims payments due
#' to inflation during the long settlement of the claims between cedent and reinsurer. \cr
#' The basic types of clauses can be divided into European Index Clauses (EIC) and London Market Indexation Clause
#' (LMIC). This package does **not** support LMIC, but the most important EIC clauses! \cr \cr
#' For a layer C xs D and a large claim with payments \eqn{p_{i}} for development year i = 1,..., T and
#' reserves \eqn{r_{i}} at the end of development year i we define \eqn{a_{i} = z_{1} + â€¦ + z_{i} + r_{i}} as the
#' claims incurred at the end of development year i. For a given index series we call \eqn{I_{B}} the index for
#' base year B and \eqn{I_{i}} the index for development year i. The indexation clauses that are supported by this
#' package define the correction factors as follows: \cr \cr
#' 1. __APK__ (for german `Anpassungsklausel`) with margin \eqn{\alpha} (with \eqn{\alpha = 10%} in many cases):
#' \deqn{
#' f_{i} :=
#' \left\{
#'    \begin{array}{r}
#'       1 \qquad if \quad \frac{I_{i}}{I_{B}} < 1 + \alpha \\
#'       \frac{I_{B}}{I_{i}} \qquad if \quad  \frac{I_{i}}{I_{B}} \ge 1 + \alpha
#'    \end{array}
#' \right.
#' }
#' 2. __SIC__ (for `Severe Inflation Clause`) with margin \eqn{\alpha} (with \eqn{\alpha = 30%} in many cases):
#' \deqn{
#' f_{i} :=
#' \left\{
#'    \begin{array}{r}
#'       1 \qquad if \quad \frac{I_{i}}{I_{B}} < 1 + \alpha \\
#'       \frac{I_{B} \cdot (1+\alpha)}{I_{i}} \qquad if \quad  \frac{I_{i}}{I_{B}} \ge 1 + \alpha
#'    \end{array}
#' \right.
#' }

#' 3. __FIC__ (for `Full` or `Franchise Inflation Clause`):
#' \deqn{f_{i} := \frac{I_{B}}{I_{i}}}
#' In some cases FIC is also defined with a margin. But unlike in APK and SIC as soon as the cumulated index exceeds
#' the margin the index is applied to the former payments as well. As this happens in most claims in longtail lines of
#' business, only FIC without margin is implemented in this package which should be a reasonable simplification.
#'
#' With the payments and the latest reserve a stabilization factor per claim and per development year can be calculated by:
#' \deqn{F_{i} = \frac{z_{1} + \cdots + z_{i} + r_{i}}{f_{1}z_{1} + \cdots + f_{i}z_{i} + f_{i}r_{i}}}
#' and this leads to a stabilized prioririty and limit per claim and development year:
#' \deqn{C_{i}^{stab} \ xs \ D_{i}^{stab} \quad with \quad C_{i}^{stab} = F_{i}
#' \cdot C \ and \ D_{i}^{stab} = F_{i} \cdot D.}
#' __Note that this package does not forecast reserves (only reserve classes) and therefore reserves are not considered
#' in the application of the indexation clause.__ This leads to slight deviations from the real reinsurance cashflow during
#' the claim development but the effect should be not be significant. \cr \cr
#'
#' Considering these information the structure of the parameter dataframe `reinsurance` should be as follows: \cr
#' `reinsurance` must contain one row for each origin year that shall be considered even though no reinsurance may
#' have existed in some years and must consist of the following columns:
#'    + `Origin_year` \cr type: integer or numeric. Origin year of the reinsurance structure.
#'    + `Priority` \cr type: numeric. Unindexed priority (or retention) of the xl treaty.
#'    + `Limit` \cr type: numeric. Unindexed limit of the xl treaty.
#'    + `Base_year` \cr type: integer or numeric. Base_year for the application of the indexation margin.
#'    Set this column to 0 if no indexation shall be considered or set Margin_type to "none".
#'    + `Margin_type` \cr type: character. Either "FIC", "SIC", "APK" or "none" for no indexation.
#'    + `Margin` \cr type: numeric. Margin \eqn{\alpha}, e.g. 0.1 for a margin of 10%. If Margin_type equals `FIC`, this
#'    column will be set to 0. If Margin_type equals `none`, this column will be ignored.
#'    + `Quota_share` \cr type: numeric. If a quota share reinsurance is to be considered, this must be the reinsurance share,
#'    e.g. 0.2 if the reinsurance pays 20% of each claim.
#'
#'
#' @return numeric matrix with one row per claim containing reinsurer's payments.
#' The number of columns depends on the `output` parameter.
