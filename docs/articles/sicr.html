<p>This package implements the stochastic individual claims reserving
(sicr) that was first published by Dirk Skowasch and Torsten Grabarz
(see 08.03.2022 on <a href="https://www.qx-club.de/ARCHIV/" class="external-link uri">https://www.qx-club.de/ARCHIV/</a>). It is based on the
paper of <a href="https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/database/forum_06fforum_209.pdf" class="external-link">Murphy
&amp; McLennan</a> but extends it in some areas for better applicability
under Solvency II.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the year-to-year development of every single
large claim is sampled from a pool of historic observations of similar
claims. Repeating this will lead to a monte carlo simulation from which
best estimates for future gross and reinsurance payments can be
derived.</p>
<p>The most significant extensions and differences to Murphy/McLennan
are</p>
<ul>
<li>the use of reserve classes to classify open claims.</li>
<li>the focus on absolute payments instead of development factors, thus
indexation is required.</li>
<li>the consideration of annuities.</li>
</ul>
<p>This vignette offers a step by step guide to use the package. It also
includes some technical explanations, but does not offer a detailed
description of the method. This can instead be found in the above linked
article.</p>

<p>At some points development triangles are used and filled up to
rectangles.</p>
<p>This package (with very few exceptions) always uses the
<strong>calendar year representation</strong>, which means that rows
represent origin years and columns represent calendar years.</p>
<p>Payment entries are always <strong>incremental</strong>. Reserve
entries resemble the reserve at the end of the column’s calendar
year.</p>

<h3 id="dividing-into-small-large-and-special-claims">Dividing into small, large and special claims<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dividing-into-small-large-and-special-claims"></a>
</h3>
<p>A claim is considered <strong>large</strong> if its cumulated indexed
payments plus its latest indexed reserve exceed the chosen
threshold.<br><strong>Note that only payments after and in the year that the claim
exceeded the threshold will be considered as large claim payments. All
payments before belong to small claims.</strong><br>
Large claims payments are projected with the stochastic individual
claims reserving method.</p>
<p>Some claims might be extraordinarily large (or <em>different</em> in
any other way) so that there haven’t been enough similar historic
observations that can be used to project them with. These claims are
called <strong>special claims</strong>. They are seperated from the rest
and projected deterministically (see description below).</p>
<p>We obtain small claims payments and reserves triangles by subtracting
large and special claims’ development triangles from the overall
development triangles.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="annuities">Annuities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#annuities"></a>
</h3>
<p>In some countries it is common to convert recurring payments into
annuities. Usually the actuary then gets access to some additional
biometric information about the annuity recipient that can be used to
improve the estimate of future payments. This package allows for the
separate treatment of annuities, but some extra input dataframes and
matrices will be required. In that case, dataframe columns like
<code>Cl_payment_cal</code> (for claims payments in one specified
calendar year) do not include annuity payments as they are included in
<code>An_payment_cal</code>. If annuities are irrelevant or are
considered as common claim payments, all annuity columns must be 0 and
the annuity dataframes can be set to NULL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ibnr-claims">IBNR claims<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ibnr-claims"></a>
</h3>
<p>IBNR claims are calculated as described in the paper with an additive
method for the <strong>number</strong> and a sampling from historic IBNR
large claims for the <strong>amount</strong> of each expected claim. Two
parameters need to be selected as input for the IBNR method:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The dataframe <code>exposure</code> will be used for the additive
method and is described below.</li>
<li>The vector <code>years_for_ibnr_pools</code> contains the calendar
years that shall be used to build the pools to sample the amount
from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both parameters will be needed in the function <code><a href="../reference/sicr.html">sicr()</a></code>.
They may also be NULL, in that case a constant exposure and all observed
calendar years will be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="reinsurance">Reinsurance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reinsurance"></a>
</h3>
<p>The method can be applied on a gross basis without reinsurance by
setting the <code>reinsurance</code> dataframe to NULL, but this would
deprive the method of one of its main advantages. If reinsurance shall
be included, the help of the function <code><a href="../reference/xl_cashflow.html">xl_cashflow()</a></code>
provides detailed information about how the dataframe
<code>reinsurance</code> needs to be structured. Furthermore, the
dataframe <code>historic_indices</code> resp. <code>indices</code> must
contain the column <code>Index_re</code>, see help of
<code>indices_xmpl</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="matrix-naming-convention">Matrix naming convention<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#matrix-naming-convention"></a>
</h3>
<p>With the above stated, it is useful to introduce a naming
convention:</p>
<p>A payments or reserve matrix’ name consists of three parts, each
separated by an underline, e.g. <code>large_claims_paid</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first part is one of
<ul>
<li><code>all</code></li>
<li><code>small</code></li>
<li>
<code>large</code> or</li>
<li>
<code>special</code><br>
and describes where the claim belongs to.<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The second part is either
<ul>
<li>
<code>claims</code> or</li>
<li>
<code>annuities</code><br>
depending on whether the payment (or reserve) is a pure claims payment
(that means without annuity payments) or an annuity payment.<br>
It can also be one of</li>
<li>
<code>known_annuities</code> and</li>
<li>
<code>future_annuities</code><br>
if annuity payments are split into these two parts as in small and large
claims.<br>
It can furthermore be one of</li>
<li>
<code>ibnr</code> for IBNR claims</li>
<li>
<code>ceded_xl</code> for reinsurance share of xl treaties or</li>
<li>
<code>ceded_quota</code> for reinsurance share of quota share
treaties.<br>
Note that the latter three don’t seperate into claims’ and annuities’
payments.<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The third part is one of <code>paid</code>, <code>reserved</code>,
<code>prediction</code> and <code>payments</code> where
<ul>
<li>
<code>paid</code> is the upper right triangle of historic
payments.</li>
<li>
<code>reserved</code> is the upper right triangle of historic
reserves. Note that no reserves will be projected so there is no need to
divide historic from future reserves matrices.</li>
<li>
<code>prediction</code> is the matrix of future payments. It always
consists of the origin years as rows and <strong>250 future calendar
years</strong> as columns. Of course non-null payments end at the latest
at around 100 to 120 years, but due to technical reasons, this long
duration had to be set.</li>
<li>
<code>payments</code> is the binding of <code>paid</code> and
<code>prediction</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="input-dataframes-and-matrices">Input dataframes and matrices<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#input-dataframes-and-matrices"></a>
</h2>
<p>Every required dataframe or matrix is well documented in the
functions where it is used and has an example delivered with this
package which is named by the suffix <em><em>xmpl<em>. As these data
tend to be quite large, some dataframes are also delivered in a minimal
version with the prefix </em>minimal</em></em> to show the
functionalities in the clearest possible way.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="claims_data">claims_data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#claims_data"></a>
</h3>
<p>The most crucial dataframe is the <code>claims_data</code>
dataframe.</p>
<p>It must contain one row for each calendar year per claim where at
least one of the columns <code>Cl_payment_cal</code>,
<code>Cl_reserve</code>, <code>An_payment_cal</code> and
<code>An_reserve</code> is not 0.</p>
<p><code>claims_data</code> must contain each claim that occured between
<code>first_orig_year</code> and <code>last_orig_year</code> that may be
large <strong>after indexation</strong>. To take indexation into
account, chose an internal threshold for your data extraction that is
significantly smaller than the threshold that shall be used here.</p>
<p><code>claims_data</code> may also contain all small claims, but this
will slow down the data preparation process.</p>
<p>To consider older claims
(<code>origin year &lt; last_orig_year</code>) for which history is only
available from <code>first_orig_year</code> until now, add one row for
this claim for calendar year <code>first_orig_year - 1</code> and fill
<code>Cl_payment_cal</code> and <code>An_payment_cal</code> with the
<strong>cumulated payments</strong> up to that year and
<code>Cl_reserve</code> and <code>An_reserve</code> with the reserve at
the end of <code>first_orig_year - 1</code>. This allows for checking if
a claim belongs to large or small claims. Due to the missing first part
of the history the development year of growing large can’t be determined
for these claims. Thus, an additional parameter
<code>Dev_year_of_growing_large</code> is required, the average
development year in which a claim exceeds the threshold. See details of
the function <code><a href="../reference/prepare_data.html">prepare_data()</a></code> for more information.</p>
<p>The dataframe must look like this:</p>

smaller than 0 (see dataframe below). It is necessary that these ages
get assigned a mortality probability, too. The probability for the
maximum age per gender must be 1.</p>

<p>As sicr works with absolute payments, indexation is required. Thus, a
dataframe <code>indices</code> needs to be created. The two helper
functions <code><a href="../reference/expand_historic_indices.html">expand_historic_indices()</a></code> and
<code><a href="../reference/add_transition_factor.html">add_transition_factor()</a></code> offer support to generate this
dataframe. It is highly recommended to use these functions instead of
building the dataframe <code>indices</code> on your own as the functions
add attributes that will be required during the simulation process.</p>
<p>One input of the function <code><a href="../reference/expand_historic_indices.html">expand_historic_indices()</a></code> is
the dataframe <code>historic_indices</code> which might look like
this:</p>

<p>Before applying the function <code>add_transition_factor</code> an
<code>index_year</code> needs to be chosen. This is a very important
choice as every payment and every reserve is indexed to this year. The
threshold and the reserve classes are fixed to the monetary value of
<code>index_year</code>. This parameter should be kept fixed over the
years to guarantee that the separation between large and small claims
and the assignment of reserve classes don’t change from year to
year.</p>

<p>These matrices with the origin years from
<code>first_orig_year</code> to <code>last_orig_year</code> as rows and
the same calendar years as columns are required to compute small claims
triangles by subtracting large and special claims triangles from them.
Small claim triangles can then be used for standard claims reserving
methods like chain ladder.</p>

<p>See description above, but for annuities paid (reserved) instead of
claims paid (reserved).</p>
<p>The only difference is that these matrices are not necessary for the
best estimate calculation, as future and known annuities for small
claims are calculated by the dataframes <code>pool_of_annuities</code>
and <code>active_annuities</code>. Thus, <code>all_annuities_paid</code>
and <code>all_annuities_reserved</code> may be set to NULL.</p>
<p>However, if you want to get a view on the overall ultimate, these
matrices are required.</p>

<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/prepare_data.html">prepare_data()</a></code> edits the dataframe
<code>claims_data</code> in one step, processing the following
tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data is reduced to <strong>possible</strong> large claims</li>
<li>claims_data is requested to only contain rows in which one of
Cl_reserve, An_reserve, Cl_payment_cal or An_payment_cal is not equal to
0. This step adds rows so that claims_data contains one row per calendar
year between the origin year and the last origin year for each
claim.</li>
<li>Adding new columns like cumulated payments, incurred columns and
entry reserves.</li>
<li>Add all indexed columns like <code>Ind_cl_payment_cal</code> derived
from <code>Cl_payment_cal</code> and <code>indices</code>.</li>
<li>Filter to actual large claims and add derived columns, e.g. the
development year the claim grew large or the development year since the
year it grew large.</li>
<li>Add entry and exit reserve class columns.</li>
<li>Attach future annuities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every step is explained further in the details section of
<code>?prepare_data()</code>.</p>
<p>The output of this function is called
<code>extended_claims_data</code> from now on and in following

<p>The parameter vector <code>years_for_pools</code> allows to chose the
calendar years of which the payments are included in the pools. This may
be useful if a trend is assumed or if one or more conspicuous calendar
years shall not be included at all. If both is not the case, just use
<code>years_for_pools = first_orig_year:last_orig_year</code> to include
every available calendar year.</p>
<p>The parameter <code>start_of_tail</code> defines the year of
transition to the tail method. All payments during the tail are
aggregated to one pool per reserve class, that is <strong>not</strong>
seperated by development years like in earlier development years. The
amount of possible payments is then reduced linearly until
<code>end_of_tail</code>. See <code><a href="../reference/tail_factor.html">?tail_factor</a></code> for the applied
formula or read the tail section in the paper for a more detailed
explanation.</p>
<p>The outlier limits set extreme payments to the desired parameter. For
example, you may choose <code>lower_outlier_limit = 0</code> to maximize
all negative payments to 0.</p>
<p>If parts or single rows of <code>extended_claims_data</code> shall
not be considered for the pools, these rows must be deleted before
applying this function. This could for example be the case if an unusual
or special claim payment is observed that is not considered to be
representative for other claims.</p>
<p>The output <code>pools</code> is not created to a
<em>nice-to-read-format</em>. It will be a parameter of the function
<code><a href="../reference/sicr.html">sicr()</a></code> and should only be used for that purpose.</p>
<p>Alternatively an external pool may be imported here.</p>

<p>Sometimes a claims reserve is much larger than every reserve that was
observed in history. It would be inadequate to project the future
payments of this claim with the pools that have been created from that
history. The resulting best estimate would underestimate the actual
payments most of the times. Other claims may be of a certain kind that
has not been observed yet. These cannot be projected by the pools
either.<br>
Although the first example will be dominant in most cases, we call all
those claims <strong>special claims</strong> to make it obvious that it
does not necessarily have to be a very large claim.</p>

<p>It is very hard to automatically identify the above second example of
special claims. A regular exchange of information with the claims
settling department is highly recommended to be informed about those
claims as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For the other kind of special claims, the extraordinarily large
claims, a comparison of the claims reserves of large claims with the
claims reserves of the historic observations in the pools is very
useful. The function <code><a href="../reference/plot_identify_special_claims.html">plot_identify_special_claims()</a></code> was
built for this purpose. It delivers a graphical assistance for that

<p><strong>Note: The development year of the current large claims in the
plot is the first year to be simulated, so in the calendar year
<code>last_orig_year</code> it will be one year less.</strong></p>
<p>The plot draws the historical observations of entry reserves on the
left and the current large claims reserves on the right. This shows for
which large claims there have only been very few similar claims in
history. In this example, one claim in development year 8 of around 5.8
Mio. reserve, two in development year 9, one in development year 14 and
one in the tail are obviously too big to be simulated with the observed
history.</p>

<p>Others claims like in development year 2, 5, 7 or 10 are further
candidates that need more detailed analysis. They will be treated as

<p>In the end, the decision about which claims to seperate from large

<p>Once the special claims are identified, they will be separated from
the <em>regular</em> large claims and reserved deterministically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Active annuities</strong> are rolled out by multiplying the
expected payments with the survival probabilities of the annuity
recipient.</li>
<li>
<strong>Claims reserves</strong> must be transitioned to a best
estimate and rolled out to the future. Thus, the dataframe
<code>special_claims</code> needs to be created with the following
information:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Claim_id</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Reserve2BE_percentage</strong> with the information about
how much of the reserve will be needed for the rest of the claim
settlement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Rollout_type</strong> with one of <code>linear</code>,
<code>constant</code> and <code>external</code>. In case of
<code>external</code> the pattern_id must be defined in the column
<strong>Pattern_id</strong>.</li>
<li>(<strong>Pattern_id</strong> An integer that refers to the entry of
the list <code>external_patterns</code> where concrete patterns may be
chosen. As this is very rare for a specific claim in longtail business,
we only use the rollout type <code>linear</code> here and set
Reserve2BE_precentage to 80%.)</li>

</ul>
<p>This is explained in more detail in the details section of

<p>The parameter <code>years_for_ibnr_pools</code> determines the
calendar years that shall be taken into account for IBNR claims.</p>
<p><code>sim_result</code> is an array with one matrix for:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sum of gross payments</li>
<li>Sum of reinsurance payments</li>
<li>Claim payments (without annuity payments)</li>
<li>Payments for active annuities</li>
<li>Payments for expected future annuities</li>
<li>Reinsurance payments from xl treaties</li>
<li>Reinsurance payments from quota share treaties</li>

<p>Each matrix contains one row per known claim plus one row per
expected IBNR claim and 250 columns for future calendar years.</p>
<p>As an example, this shows the overall gross payments for the next 5
years for the last 50 claims:</p>

<p>Small claims can be derived as the difference between all claims and
special + large claims.</p>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/compute_small_claims.html">compute_small_claims()</a></code> computes all small
claim estimates in one step. This includes the following parts:</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="claim-payments">claim payments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#claim-payments"></a>
</h4>
<p>Claim payments are projected via a standard chain ladder method. The
possibility of reducing the used years for the chain ladder factors as
well as the use of external patterns is implemented. As a standard, a
paid method and an incurred method will be calculated and then
aggregated as weighted sums.</p>
<p>The following parameters are required, all of them may be NULL which
leads to the use of the standard chain paid and incurred chain ladder
that are merged with equal weights.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>volume_paid_method:</strong> Number of newest calendar years
to be used for paid chain ladder factors.</li>
<li>
<strong>volume_indurred_method:</strong> Number of newest calendar
years to be used for incurred chain ladder factors.</li>
<li>
<strong>external_paid_pattern:</strong> external pattern for paid
method, see <code>?generate_pattern()</code> for usage.</li>
<li>
<strong>external_incurred_pattern:</strong> external pattern for
incurred method, see <code>?generate_pattern()</code> for usage.</li>
<li>
<strong>int2ext_transition_paid:</strong> year of switching to
external paid pattern, see <code>?generate_pattern()</code> for
usage.</li>
<li>
<strong>int2ext_transition_incurred:</strong> year of switching to
external incurred pattern, see <code>?generate_pattern()</code> for

<li>
<strong>weight_paid:</strong> weight of paid method for weighted

<p>The package offers two functions to write the results into clearly
arranged excel worksheets. Both use <code>openxlsx2</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>add_sicr_worksheet</strong> adds a worksheet to a workbook
with payments and (optional) reserves as arguments</li>
<li>
<strong>add_sicr_aggr_worksheet</strong> adds an aggregated
worksheet to a workbook from several existing worksheets, for example to
add small, large and special claims to overall claims. Subtracting is
also possible, for example to get the net view from gross and
reinsurance payments.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following example creates a complete results workbook with
separating dummy worksheets and a reasonable order (small examples can
be found in the functions documentation):</p>
